## Introduction 
•	Github Link Pages site.
https://louis-funes.github.io/Group-Project-Base-101-05/
•	Title project
Explore articles from the API Smithsonian.
•	Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones? Which versions?)
So far, the application is for web browser, but it can be used by any smartphone device. The only issue right now is that the coding is designed for browser. Nevertheless, the coding for tablets and devices can be created on CSS so the information adjusts according to the display that the user is using. 


## Description
- What API did you use, link to the API
The API that I used for this project is Smithsonian Institution Open Access API
https://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/#api-_

- What visualizations does your project drive?
My project gives a visualization of the articles that the user is searching while having the date that the article was published. Furthermore, I used doughnut visualization.

- What visualization or other JS libraries does your project use?
The library that was essential to this project is the Chart.js library and as mentioned early I represented my data with a doughnut visualization where will display the article and the data posted.

- What CSS frameworks did you use? What version of them?
The approach that I took is was using the framework or methods that we taught in class so pretty much I code my own CSS design.

- What is your actual project trying to display and solve?
My idea of my project was to give the user the ability to search any old or new article where it would have the date specifying that. Moreover, this would help to people to search by dates and to identify sometimes old information with new information. For example, if they search for Covid articles it is better that the articles are recent. Yet, if they are looking for prehistory articles, it is better that the dates are old dates.
